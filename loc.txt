The biggest thing to note about our system is that not everything in it is 
actually utilized; our test suite tests to make sure that melding, which takes 
up a decent amount of code, works correctly, but because of the nature of this 
game (where only one player can play at a time), implementing this functionality
within the actual game logic proved too difficult to do in the time span. We 
would needed to have gotten a server set up, which is a whole new beast to 
tackle. 

Outside of that, in game.ml, there are 2 versions of discard: one for use with
a gui, and one without. This is because windows users were unable to use
bogue, so we made a new version of the game that did not require graphics. 
There is slight code duplication there, but they act different for the most part
so hopefully that isn't too problematic. These comprise about 50 lines of code;
feel free to dock 50-75 lines from the total for these.
