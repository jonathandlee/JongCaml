  Our project is an implementation of Japanese Ricchii Mahjong in Ocaml. It 
  supports standard 4 player mahjong against other players as well as single
  player interactivity. The project features a fully functioning gui system
  that gives players a visual representation of their current hand, as well as 
  all of their discards and other players discards.
