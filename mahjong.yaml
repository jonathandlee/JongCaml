  EPILEPSY WARNING: Bogue is a questionable library. Our game implementation
  requires re-rendering of the board upon state reset, which causes flashing
  lights. Please be advised and warned about this!!!
  Our project is an implementation of Japanese Ricchii Mahjong in Ocaml. It 
  supports standard 4 player mahjong against other players as well as single
  player interactivity. The project features a fully functioning gui system
  that gives players a visual representation of their and other player's current
  hands. This version of mahjong has a slight twist: you can see the tiles of
  the player directly across from you! This changes the strategy present in
  the original game: you now have more information on what tiles a single of
  your opponents have, but so do they. Act accordingly!
